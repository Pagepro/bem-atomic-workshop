# BEM and Atomic Design Workshop Boilerplate
This is a very basic starting point for new web projects. It takes no assumptions about your tech stack and there is no binding to any javascript frameworks or backend systems.

The boilerplate includes gulp, sass, sourcemaps, autoprefixer, breakpoint and browsersync. And nothing else.

## Requirements
1. [node v8.12.0 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Quickstart
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Pagepro/bem-atomic-workshop
$ cd bem-atomic-workshop
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

The page will be available at: http://localhost:3000/ (it should open automatically after yarn start command)

## Directory structure explanation

* **/** - root directory with html files and configuration files
* **src** - directory with source files
* **img** - directory with png, jpg and svg files
* **css** - directory with complied css file
* **index.html** - main html file with homepage (the page where you should start, it will redirect you to other pages)
* **styleguide.html** - styleguide html file
